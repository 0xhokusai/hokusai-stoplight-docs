### Mint

To mint an NFT means to issue an NFT. See more information [here](https://help.foundation.app/en/articles/4742869-a-complete-guide-to-minting-an-nft).

### Gas Fees
All transactions are required to pay a transaction fee, called a gas fee.
Typically, users must have enough ETH to pay for the gas spent (On [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), users must have [MATIC](https://polygon.technology/matic-token/) tokens).
It is not an easy task for newcomers to accumulate enough ETH for the gas fee. As a result, Hokusai is providing meta-transaction to cover users' gas fees.

### Meta Transactions

Meta-transactions mean transactions that a third party (called a relayer) can send another user's transactions and pay themselves for the gas cost.
By using Hokusai API, Users can easily use meta-transaction.
