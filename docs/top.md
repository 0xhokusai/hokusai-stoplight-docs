# Welcome to Hokusai API. 

## Fast and Easy for NFT 🌊🗻
## A fully integrated set of NFT functions ⚡️
Mint, send, set royalty, burn, see data, all NFT functions. All Hokusai APIs are included. Hokusais API will enhance the NFT marketplace and platform for all art, collectibles, sports, and admission tickets.  
In addition, Hokusai will pay all the troublesome GAS fees (network fees). You can start your own NFT business without having to go through the trouble of getting crypto assets from crypto exchanges or managing a wallet.

## No Gas fees, No cryptocurrency 🥳
Since Hokusai pays fees to the blockchain network on behalf of its users, you do not need to prepare GAS fees (network fees) for minting and transferring NFTs.

## No blockchain engineers 🥷
If you want to develop NFT products, you need blockchain engineers. Hokusai API helps you integrate NFT into your own website without blockchain engineer, just as you can integrate payment functions using Stripe.

## Flexible Support System 🚑
There are several blockchain engineers on the Hokusai team. If you have any questions about product development, please feel free to contact us.
