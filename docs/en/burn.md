# Burn NFT

Hokusai uses [Transfer function](glosarry.md#meta-transactions) to burn NFT.

## What is Burn NFT ?

Burn in NFT means to make the NFT unusable again.
It can be burned by sending the private key to a wallet that no one knows about.

In the case of Polygon, it is generally possible to burn it by sending it to 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000.
