### Mint

To mint an NFT means to issue an NFT. See more information [here](https://help.foundation.app/en/articles/4742869-a-complete-guide-to-minting-an-nft).

### Meta Transactions

All transactions are required to pay transaction fee, called gas fee.
So normally, users must have enough ETH to pay for the gas spent (In case for polygon, users must have MATIC).
It is not easy task for newcomers to get enough ETH.
So we provide meta-transaction to cover users gas fee. 
Meta-transactions mean transactions that a third-party (called a relayer) can send another userâ€™s transactions and pay themselves for the gas cost.
By using Hokusai API, Users can easily use meta-transaction.
